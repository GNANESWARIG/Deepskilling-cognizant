Big O Notation:
Big O notation describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size (n). It focuses on upper bounds — the worst-case scenario.

Notation	Description	Example
O(1)	-Constant time	Hash lookup
O(log n)	-Logarithmic time	Binary Search
O(n)	-Linear time	Linear Search
O(n²)-	Quadratic time	Nested loops

Search Operation Scenarios:
Case	Linear Search (O(n))	Binary Search (O(log n))
Best	O(1) – found at start	O(1) – found at middle
Average	O(n/2) ≈ O(n)	O(log n)
Worst	O(n) – not found	O(log n) – not found
