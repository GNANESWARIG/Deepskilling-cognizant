Time Complexity Comparison:
Linear Search has a time complexity of O(n). This means that in the worst-case scenario, 
the algorithm might need to check every element in the array to find a match or determine that no match exists.
It doesnâ€™t require the data to be sorted, which makes it easy to use but inefficient for large datasets.

Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n). It works by repeatedly dividing 
the search space in half and checking the middle element, which makes it significantly 
faster than linear search as the size of the data grows. However, it requires the data to be sorted beforehand.

Suitability for an E-Commerce Platform:
For an e-commerce platform where users frequently search for products by name or category,
binary search is generally more suitable due to its performance advantages. 
If the product list is large and relatively static (doesn't change often), 
sorting the list once and performing binary search will drastically improve search speed.

However, if the product list is small or changes very frequently (with new additions or deletions), 
maintaining the sorted order might introduce overhead. In such cases, linear search may be easier to manage initially.

Final Recommendation:
While linear search is simple to implement, binary search is the better choice for optimizing performance
in search functionality, especially on large and mostly static datasets like product listings in an e-commerce platform.
For even better performance, especially with dynamic datasets, using more advanced data structures like
hash maps or search indexes would be advisable in a real-world application.
